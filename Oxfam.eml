>Further to my previous email dated 22/01/24 I have still not received any r=
esponse.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So it would appear that I raise a co=
mplaint, absolutely nothing is done regarding it, instead my son is pulled i=
nto the office for questioning regarding a complaint against him not a week l=
ater or so. It was reported he had hurt someone=E2=80=99s hand when taking a=
 box of donations from them. This was an accident and he had apologised at t=
he time. Also another complaint alleging something happened which was also c=
ompletely taken out of context. The person was not a long standing volunteer=
 and she had apparently raised a complaint after she left. Both of these peo=
ple were friends and also close friends with victor!&nbsp;</div><div><br></d=
iv><div>After the meeting was finished my son asked what happens now. The la=
dy conducting the meeting asked what he felt would be a good course of actio=
n next. He said he would apologise again to the person who he accidentally h=
urt her hand as soon as he saw her. He also said he would be far more carefu=
l in future and insist people put things down from now on and he will not ta=
ke them from anyone The lady agreed this was a good idea and that=E2=80=99s w=
hat should happen moving forward.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I then emai=
l you again questioning what=E2=80=99s happening with this complaint, The ne=
xt thing he knows not a couple of days later the area manager is in and spea=
king to victor in the office. (The two people our complaint was regarding!) h=
e is then pulled into the office yet again and told by one of the people he r=
aised a complaint about and the other lady that they=E2=80=99ve spoken about=
 the complaint made by the volunteers and they=E2=80=99ve decided he was no l=
onger going to be working there. 5yrs of dedication, long hours, sometimes 5=
 days a week and being a key holder, stepping up as manager whenever George w=
as on holiday for a couple of years, plus so much more. And he raises a comp=
laint and is treated in this way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Needless to=
 say we will be taking this further and have taken some advice already. Volu=
nteer or employee, everyone has the same right when it comes to a complaint.=
 Anthony has been taken advantage of because of his condition, knowing he sh=
ould not be spoken with alone regarding anything, he was not given notice fo=
r discussing matters, the whole situation from this complaint to the conveni=
ent timings of complaints from victors friends and him being spoken to by th=
e people he raised complaints regarding, all of which is completely unaccept=
able and not within guidelines.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally havin=
g been completely ignored regarding Anthony and I original complaint is appa=
lling. All of the above matters are not being ignored by us even if oxfam ar=
e ignoring official complaints.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>All of the ab=
ove are completely unacceptable.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Regards</div=

 time of the race riots and because of the riots spoke with them about Antho=
ny leaving the shop early so he could get home safely. Also enquired with th=
e Shop Manager how they would get home as was concerned for their safety and=
 said - (verbatim) -<i>
<b><span style=3D"color:black">"Concerned for your welfare as you are vulner=
able and of the type of background that is the target"</span></b></i><b><spa=
n style=3D"color:black">.</span></b> Anthony was present at this conversatio=
n but did not say anything to the
 Shop Manager.</span><br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">I h=
ave a pleasant relationship with the former shop manager and stay in touch v=
ia social media.</span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">It=
 has now come to light that the former shop manager has put a complaint in s=
tating that Anthony and I were racist. I don't understand this could be perc=
eived as a racist comment or become a complaint.</span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Je=
n has since conducted a formal investigation, with someone present taking no=
tes/minutes and asked to speak with Anthony about the complaint. Anthony was=
 not warned prior to this meeting, did not
 receive an invitation to attend said meeting and not given the opportunity f=
or anyone to be present with him.</span><br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">No=
r have I been invited to discuss this matter although it was I and not Antho=
ny who said it. Antony is vulnerable and not familiar with procedure and we b=
elieve Jen has not followed correct procedure
 - ACAS guidelines. Anthony has been taken advantage of and why was Anthony s=
poke to in a way of a formal investigation when he wasn't even the person wh=
o made the welfare comment to the former shop manager. At no point have I be=
en contacted to discuss the
 matter. Anthony was left with that Jen would be in touch with the outcome -=
 which Anthony does not understand.</span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Je=
ns behaviour is totally unacceptable and would like to make a formal complai=
nt about her.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"=
>Second complaint :-</span></b><br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">An=
tony mentioned that he had to give a witness statement about a complaint tha=
t had been submitted against Victor (DSM) and that Victor witnessed Anthony c=
oming out of the office when this meeting
 was held.</span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Si=
nce then Victor has displayed bullying aggressive behaviour towards Anthony -=
 shouting at him on the shop floor, cutting his hours from the rota, accused=
 Anthony of the one submitting the complaint,
 accused Anthony of lying when Anthony insisted to Victor it was not he who h=
ad submitted the complaint, having a go for minor and petty things, and of l=
ate just totally ignoring Anthony.</span><br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">An=
thony feels he is being forced out of his volunteering position and is extre=
mely upset. Anthony loves volunteering at the shop and feels has a great wor=
king relationship with everyone. Mrs Gibson
 feels this is a form of constructive dismissal.</span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Vi=
ctor has said to Anthony that - (verbatim) -
<b><i>"Until I find out who has made this complaint against me this is how i=
t's going to be"</i></b> and
<b><i>" I will ensure when the new Shop Manager comes that they will get rid=
 of you"</i></b> and<b><i> "No one wants to work with you".</i></b></span><b=
r>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Vi=
ctor has scolded Anthony for shutting the shop early - Anthony could get hol=
d of Victor (he had left to go and 'do something else') - didn't answer his p=
hone - and as Anthony would be the only
 staff member on site as the other volunteer had called in sick, Anthony fol=
lowed Oxfam procedure. Anthony then received a text form Victor at 6:30 that=
 evening scolding him for shutting the shop and that
<b><i>" he should have kept on trying to call Victor".</i></b></span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">An=
thony has not been sent the rota and when turned up for normal Sunday shift w=
as berated aggressively by Victor and shouted at
<b><i>"not needed"</i></b></span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Mr=
s Gibson is very upset and disappointed at the treatment of her son. Mrs Gib=
son is angry at being accused of being racist and does not want the complain=
t against the DSM going to the AM in light
 of the complaint towards them.</span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Mr=
s Gibson emailed Speak UP 12/11 to report bullying and the incorrect procedu=
re followed.</span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Mr=
s Gibson would prefer email as cannot always answer a call when at work but g=
ave permission for their mobile number to be shared.</span><br>
